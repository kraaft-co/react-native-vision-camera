/**

 * * `"none"`: Indicates that autofocus is not available
 * * `"contrast-detection"`: Indicates that autofocus is achieved by contrast detection. Contrast detection performs a focus scan to find the optimal position
 * * `"phase-detection"`: Indicates that autofocus is achieved by phase detection. Phase detection has the ability to achieve focus in many cases without a focus scan. Phase detection autofocus is typically less visually intrusive than contrast detection autofocus
